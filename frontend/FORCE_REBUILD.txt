FORCE REBUILD - FIXED EXPRESS SERVER
Timestamp: 2025-01-11T16:30:00.000Z
Version: EXPRESS_FIX_v1.0.0

This file forces Railway to rebuild with the new Express server configuration.
The server now properly handles static files and should serve JavaScript correctly.

Expected behavior:
- main.62ae4dd7.js should load as JavaScript, not HTML
- Express server should log all requests
- Static files should have correct Content-Type headers
- SPA routing should work correctly

DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE UNTIL RAILWAY REBUILD IS CONFIRMED.
