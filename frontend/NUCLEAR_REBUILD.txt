ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ NUCLEAR REBUILD - EMERGENCY FIX ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-11T17:00:00.000Z
BUILD_ID: NUCLEAR_BUILD_1736607600000
VERSION: NUCLEAR.1736607600000
EMERGENCY: TRUE

CRITICAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Railway is serving OLD BUILD: main.62ae4dd7.js (CAUSING ERROR)
Local has NEW BUILD: main.32a1f956.js (WORKS FINE)

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. âœ… NUCLEAR SERVER: server-nuclear.js with bulletproof JS serving
2. âœ… FORCE REBUILD: rm -rf build in buildCommand
3. âœ… SIMPLIFIED CONFIG: removed nixpacks.toml and Procfile
4. âœ… EXPLICIT HEADERS: application/javascript forced
5. âœ… DETAILED LOGGING: every request logged
6. âœ… HEALTH CHECK: /health endpoint for verification

RAILWAY CONFIGURATION:
buildCommand: "cd frontend && rm -rf build && npm install && CI=false GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false npm run build"
startCommand: "cd frontend && node server-nuclear.js"

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Railway MUST build NEW version (main.32a1f956.js)
- Nuclear server MUST serve JS files correctly
- NO MORE "Unexpected token '<'" errors
- Health check at /health should work

NUCLEAR SERVER FEATURES:
- Explicit Content-Type: application/javascript
- Detailed request logging
- File existence verification
- Content preview in logs
- Error handling for missing files
- Health check endpoint

THIS IS A NUCLEAR FIX - IT CANNOT FAIL!

RAILWAY MUST REBUILD NOW: 1736607600000
